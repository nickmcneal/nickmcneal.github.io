            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                The "free energy principle" is a theoretical framework that aims to explain the behavior of living systems. 
                It is based on the idea that biological systems, including the brain, are driven by a fundamental imperative to minimize a quantity called "free energy." 
                This principle has been proposed as a unifying theory of brain function and has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, from perception and action to learning and decision-making.
                The theory has often been criticized as being difficult to understand due to the notational complexity in the original papers. 
                In recent months, I have tried to fully grasp the mathematics behind the theory, and in this blog post, I will attempt to document what I have learned and explored.
